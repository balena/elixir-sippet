  If the message is a request, then it will look if a server transaction

  is `:ack`, it will redirect the request directly to `Sippet.Core`; if not
  `:ack`, then a new `Sippet.Transactions.Server` will be created.

  If the message is a response, it looks if a client transaction already exists

  redirected directly to the `Sippet.Core`. The latter is done so because of
  the usual SIP behavior or handling the 200 OK response retransmissions for
  requests with `:invite` method directly.
